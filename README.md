# Coding Interview Trainning

This repo was made after I failed in an interview programming test. The main purpose is to practice doing programming challenges common in technical interviews.

The code must work in some scenarios asked by the source where it was obtained and the comments around it must explain what was the approach to solve the challenge.

## How to use

Just use cmake to build the specific platform build tool and compile the project. Each executable has its own folder and README explaining its objective.

## Documentation

The documentation in this project is generated using doxygen. To generate useful documentation about this repo download or build doxygen and use it like in the command line bellow:

```
doxygen
```

The documentation will be generated in the docs folder.
